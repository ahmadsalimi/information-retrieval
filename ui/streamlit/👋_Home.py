    ## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
    
    This is a demo for the course Modern Information Retrieval at Sharif University of Technology,
    created by [Ahmad Salimi](https://linkedin.com/in/ahmadsalimi).
    
    ## üíª Source Code
    
    The source code containing the jupyter notebooks for the demos, the backend, and the frontend
    of this demo is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahmadsalimi/information-retrieval).
    
    Backend is implemented with python using `gRPC` and the frontend is implemented with python using `streamlit`.

    ## üìö Datasets
    
    Four datasets collected from [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
    are used in this demo:
    
    - AI & Bioinformatics from Semantic Scholar
    - Hardware & System from Semantic Scholar
    - Random arXiv papers from 2019
    - Crawled Semantic Scholar papers with the five papers of each of the following professors as seeds:
        - [Dr. Shohreh Kasaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvx4PvgAAAAJ&hl=en)
        - [Dr. Hamid R. Rabiee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&hl=en)
        - [Dr. Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&hl=en)
        - [Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GbJMZLIAAAAJ&hl=en)
        - [Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1U0KlgAAAAJ&hl=en)

    ## ü§ñ Models

    The model used for clustering and finding similar papers is Sentence Transformer from `huggingface`
    (`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`).
    
    Search methods (`tf-idf` and `okapi25`) are implemented from scratch using `numpy`, and `pandas`.
    
    `spacy` and `nltk` are used for preprocessing.
